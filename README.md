# China-s-Urban-area-CUD-and-Urban-Built-up-area-CUBD-
The dataset of China's Urban area (CUD) and Urban Built-up area (CUBD)
The dataset is based on high-precision land cover data obtained through automated algorithmic model production, 
including urban and built-up area data for cities at and above prefecture level in China in 2015 and 2020. The urban built-up area data set is stored separately according to the city,
and is distinguished by the administrative division code of each city. For example, "Uban_110100" represents Beijing.
